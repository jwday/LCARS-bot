  "description": "My very own Discord bot written in javaScript and using discord.js API. Currently just does a few meaningless actions as I learn how to build functionality. Structure is being designed such that new commands can be added as their own .js file in the *commands* directory for organization and reduced clutter. Future intention is to stylize the resultant text and embed objects in an LCARS-like them inspired by Star Trek's computer interfaces. Still in work, some code still needs generalization to make this a turn-key bot option.",
